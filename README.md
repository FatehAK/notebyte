Jot down your thoughts with this simple note taking application. It uses **Node.js** for its backend and the routes are managed by **ExpressJS** with **EJS** (Embedded JavaScript) for dynamic 
templating. It makes note creation easy with added timestamps and the notes are stored on **MongoDB**. It is deployed to **[Render](https://render.com/)** for easy access.
